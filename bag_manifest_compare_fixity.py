"""Compares the fixity of files in a bag manifest to the data folder and creates a report of differences,
which includes files that are only in the manifest, only in the data folder, or in both places with different fixity.

Use this script after a bag validation error that indicates the size has changed.
Use bag_manifest_compare_files.py instead when the error is a different number of files, which is faster.

This script is modeled after the function validate_bag_manifest() in validate_fixity.py in the hub-monitoring repo.

Parameters:
    bag_path (required): path to the bag folder

Returns:
    bag_manifest_compare_fixity_report.csv (saved to the parent folder of the bag_path)
